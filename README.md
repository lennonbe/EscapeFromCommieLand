##### Overview:
The aim of the game is escape from the fictional county your character finds himself in, by purchasing passports. You start off the game with no money, and only a few seeds. Each seed, once fully grown, can be collected and sold for money. This money can be spent in several different ways to invest and increase the output of your farm. You must choose wisely what to spend your money on, because time is vital, and you must get out as fast as possible. Good luck!

##### Core Mechanics:
 - Select a seed you want to plant by pressing the left mouse button on the desired seed icon in the resource menu located on the top left of the screen. 
 - Plant the selected seed by walking up to and pressing the right mouse button on an empty field.
 - Once grown, walk up to the field and press left mouse button to collect, you will see your money increase in the resource menu.
 - Press left mouse button over the shop to open the shop menu.
 - Given you have enough money, you can purchase any unlocked item in the shop by hovering over it and pressing left mouse button.
