##### Overview:
The aim of the game is escape from the fictional county your character finds himself in, by purchasing passports. You start off the game with no money, and only a few seeds. Each seed, once fully grown, can be collected and sold for money. This money can be spent in several different ways to invest and increase the output of your farm. You must choose wisely what to spend your money on, because time is vital, and you must get out as fast as possible. Good luck!

##### How To Play:
-   Select a seed you want to plant by pressing the left mouse button on the desired seed icon in the resource menu located on the top left of the screen.
-   Plant the selected seed by walking up to and pressing the left mouse button on an empty field.
-   Once grown, walk up to the field and press left mouse button to collect, you will see your coins increase in the resource menu.
-   Press left mouse button over the shop (in the middle of the screen) to open the shop menu.
-   Given you have enough coins, you can purchase any unlocked item in the shop by hovering over it and pressing left mouse button.
-   You start the game with only one upgrade, and one seeds unlocked.
-   Press the left mouse button on the next locked seed to unlock it, then it will become available to purchase.
-   You cannot unlocked a seed without unlocking the previous one.
-   By unlocking a seed, you also unlocked the upgrade associated with that seed.
-   All seeds except the last one may only be bought once.
-   Finally, once you have enough coins, you may purchase the passports which are located in the top left of the shop. Passports cost 500 coins per person. Once passports are bought the game ends, and you score will be recorded.
