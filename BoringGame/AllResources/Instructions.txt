Overview:

The aim of the game is escape from the fictional county your character finds himself in, by purchasing fake passports. 
You start off the game with nothing but a few coins. Each seed, once fully grown, can be collected and sold for money. 
This money can be spent in several different ways to invest and increase the output of your farm. You must choose wisely what
to spend your money on, because time is vital, and your families lives are in your hands. Good luck!

How To Play:

    - Select a seed you want to plant by pressing the left mouse button on the desired seed 
      icon in the resource menu located on the top left of the screen.
    - Plant the selected seed by walking up to and pressing the left mouse button on an empty field.
    - Once grown, walk up to the field and press left mouse button to collect, you will see your coins
      increase in the resource menu.
    - Press left mouse button over the shop (in the middle of the screen) to open the shop menu.
    - Given you have enough coins, you can purchase any unlocked item in the shop by hovering over 
      it and pressing left mouse button.
    - Unlocked items are coloured, while locked items black. You started the game with only one seed
      and one upgrade unlocked.
    - Press the left mouse button on the next locked seed to unlock it, then it will become 
      available to purchase.
    - You cannot unlocked a seed or upgrade without unlocking the previous one.
    - By unlocking a seed, you also unlocked the upgrade associated with that seed, every seed 
      is associated with the upgrade just below it.
    - All upgrades except the last one may only be bought once.
    - Randomly throughout the game, a family member could get sick. When this happens,
      you will see a timer pop-up on the left of the screen. If you do nothing and 
      let the timer run out, there's a 50% chance that a family member will die.
      To purchase medicine, press left mouse button over the pop-up before the time runs out.
    - If two family members die, you lose the game.
    - Finally, once you have enough coins, you may purchase the passports which are located in the 
      top left of the shop. Passports cost 500 coins per person. Once passports are bought the 
      game ends, and your score will be recorded.
